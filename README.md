# Haris (Ø­Ø§Ø±Ø³)

A **gamified quest-tracking application** designed to help users stay consistent and motivated in
performing meaningful daily actions.  
The app follows a **linear level-based progression system**, where each level contains a set of
quests. Completing quests earns XP, unlocks achievements, and levels the user up to new challenges.

## ðŸŒŸ Core Concept

- **Levels**  
  Each level represents a stage of progress. A level is only complete when all its quests are
  finished.

- **Quests**  
  Tasks within a level that grant XP when completed.

- **Progression**  
  Completing quests grants XP. When all quests in a level are completed, the user advances to the
  next level.

- **Achievements**  
  Special milestones unlocked by reaching specific goals, such as completing all quests in a week or
  earning a set amount of XP.

  Events can be queued and processed one at a time, ensuring that popups and other UI triggers never
  overlap or interrupt each other.

- **Simple** â€“ Easy to use, with a clean and motivating user experience.
- **Extensible** â€“ Developers can easily add new quests, achievements, or features without rewriting
  the core.
